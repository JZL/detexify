    %h2 Want a Mac app?
    %p
      Lucky you. The Mac app is finally stable enough.
      See how it works on <a href="https://vimeo.com/160408368" target="_new">Vimeo</a>.
      Download the latest version

        %a(href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/detexify.kirelabs.org/Detexify.zip" target="_new" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://s3.amazonaws.com/detexify.kirelabs.org/Detexify.zip'); return false;") here

    %p
      <em>Restriction:</em> In addition to the LaTeX command the unlicensed version will copy a reminder to purchase a license to the clipboard
      when you select a symbol.

    %p
      You can purchase a license here:

      <script src="https://gumroad.com/js/gumroad.js"></script>
      <a class="gumroad-button" href="https://gum.co/detexify">Buy Detexify for Mac</a>

      If you need help contact
      = succeed(".") do
        %a(href="mailto:mail@danielkirs.ch") mail@danielkirs.ch

      :javascript
        var trackOutboundLink = function(url) {
           ga('send', 'event', 'outbound', 'click', url, {
             'transport': 'beacon',
             'hitCallback': function(){document.location = url;}
           });
        }
    %h2 What is this?
    %p
      Anyone who works with LaTeX knows how time-consuming it can be
      to find a symbol in
      %a{:href => "http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/"} symbols-a4.pdf
      that you just can't memorize. Detexify is an attempt to simplify this search.
    %h2 How do I use it?
    %p
      Just draw the symbol you are looking for into the square area above and look what happens!
    %h2 My symbol isn't found!
    %p
      The symbol may not be trained enough
      or it is not yet in the list of supported symbols.
      %strike In the first case you can do the training yourself.
      In the second case just drop me a line (mail@danielkirs.ch)!
      %em I am rewriting parts right now and training isn't functional in this version.
    %h2 I like this. How can I help?
    %p
      %strike You could spare some time training Detexify.
      You could also look at the source of the
      %a{:href => "http://github.com/kirel/detexify"} frontend
      and
      %a{:href => "https://github.com/kirel/detexify-hs-backend"} backend
      on Github.
      If you really, really like this
      you can also donate.
    .donate-buttons
      .paypal= partial 'paypal'
      .flattr
        %a.FlattrButton{:href => "http://detexify.kirelabs.org", :style => "display:none;", rev: "flattr;button:compact;"}
      .gratipay
        %script(data-gratipay-username="kirel" data-gratipay-widget="button" src="//gttp.co/v1.js")
    %p
      The backend server is running on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2ed6dc53403b">Digital Ocean (referral link)</a>
      so you can also reduce my hosting costs by using that referral link.
    %h2 Why should I donate?
    %p
      Hosting of detexify costs some money. If Detexify helps you, you might want to help cover these costs.
    %h2 This doesn't work at all!?
    %p
      Be sure you use a modern browser. A recent version of
      %a(href='http://www.google.com/chrome/') Chrome
      or
      %a(href='http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/') Firefox
      should do the trick.
    %h2 Do you support Unicode?
    %p
      No. Have a look at
      %a{:href => "http://shapecatcher.com"} http://shapecatcher.com
      for Unicode.
    %h2 I am a researcher. Can I use Detexify's training data?
    %p
      %a(href='https://github.com/kirel/detexify-data') Yes.
    %h2 Who created Detexify?
    %p
      Philipp KÃ¼hl had the initial idea and
      %a{:href => "http://kirelabs.org"} Daniel Kirsch
      made it happen.
